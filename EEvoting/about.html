    <h1>About the e-Voting System</h1>
    <p>
      The e-Voting System is a secure and user-friendly online platform that allows citizens to cast their votes in elections from the comfort of their homes or any location with internet access. Below is a breakdown of the system’s key features:
    </p>

    <h2>Process Overview:</h2>
    <p>
      1. <strong>Home Page:</strong> The home page serves as the starting point of the system. It provides general information about the e-Voting system and gives users the option to log in or register.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. <strong>Login Page:</strong> Users need to log in with their credentials to access the voting system. The login page verifies the user's identity and ensures only eligible voters can participate in the election process.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. <strong>Voting Page:</strong> After logging in, users are directed to the voting page, where they can select the candidates they wish to vote for. The page displays a list of candidates, along with their party names and symbols, and users can vote for their preferred candidate.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. <strong>Candidate Numbers:</strong> Each candidate is assigned a unique number. These numbers are displayed on the voting page, allowing users to identify candidates easily and cast their votes without confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. <strong>Voting Success Page:</strong> After submitting their vote, users are directed to a confirmation page, indicating that their vote was successfully cast. This page reassures users that their vote has been registered.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. <strong>Result Page:</strong> Once the voting period has ended, the result page shows the final tally of votes for each candidate, providing transparency and allowing users to see the outcome of the election.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. <strong>Dashboard Page:</strong> The dashboard is a private page for administrators to monitor the voting process. It provides insights into the number of users who have voted, candidates’ performance, and allows administrators to manage the election system in real-time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The e-Voting system ensures that the voting process is secure, transparent, and easy to use for everyone.
